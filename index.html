				<h3 class='fade-in'>What we do</h3>
<p class='fade-in'>
CSIP is a Princeton student organization founded in 2017!<br />
Our mission is to empower students to support social <br />
enterprises striving to create a better China by: <br /><br />
I. Empowering students with the knowledge and tools they<br />
need to evaluate and provide project-based support to our <br />partner organizations.<br /><br />

II. Providing a forum on campus for learning about social <br />
entrepreneurship and social-profit organizations in China<br /><br />
III. Raising an Impact Fund which CSIP students will donate <br />
to one of our partner organizations.

</p>


<h3 class='fade-in'>CSIP Program 2017 - 2018</h3>
<p class='fade-in'>
The CSIP Program gives students the opportunity to <br />
engage with the fast developing social sector in China<br />
 and Hong Kong.Our program this year runs from <br />
 <b>July 2017 to May 2018. </b><br /><br />
From July to August, students enroll in an online <br />
course on social impact and organization evaluation,<br />
 which was developed and provided to us by <br />
 Philanthropy in Motion, our strategic partner in <br />
 China. We place students in teams of three and <br />
 match them with one of our five partner social <br />
 enterprises for the year. The teams work closely <br />
 with these enterprises to gain a deep understanding <br />
 of their business, and ultimately present their <br />
 learnings in an evaluation report at the end of <br />
 the online course. Several of our partner <br />
 organizations are emerging enterprises that <br />
 lack capacity in areas where students can provide <br />
 valuable support. During the fall and spring <br />
 semesters, students work on projects for the<br />
 partner organizations, contributing their skills<br />
 while gaining deep insight into how these <br />
 organizations are creating change. Example <br />
 projects include conducting market research,<br />
 case studies,and basic financial modeling.

As the founder of CSIP, she is hoping that students will through the program become passionate about social change in China and the implications of social entrepreneurship for global sustainable development. For her senior thesis she is researching the implications of the new Foreign NGO Law in China on civil society development and rule of law, and is excited to see how her research might form a basis for future educational initiatives organized by CSIP.

										<cite>
										We believe that people can achieve <br />
better outcomes when they make <br />
collective decisions on how to <br />
donate to causes they care about<br />
During the fall semester, CSIP<br />
 is raising an Impact Fund of up <br />
 to $7,000 to provide financial <br />
 support to one of our partner <br />
 organizations. In 2018, The CSIP <br />
 cohort will collectively deliberate<br />
 and decide on how to donate the fund <br />
 to an organization they believe can<br />
 make the most impact with our <br />
 support. This aspect of what we<br />
 do is inspired by the growing <br />
 movement of venture philanthropy<br />
 around the world. We are aiming to <br />
 raise funds through Princeton alumni<br />
 and friends in the fall of 2017. <br />
 Please click here for more information<br />
 on our crowdfunding campaign, and <br />
 how you can support us.
