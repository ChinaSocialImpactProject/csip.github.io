<p class='fade-in'><span style="color:black">
CSIP is a Princeton student organization founded in 2017!
Our mission is to empower <br />students to support social
enterprises striving to create a better China by: <br /><br />
I. Empowering students with the knowledge and tools they
need to evaluate and <br />provide project-based support to our partner organizations.<br /><br />

II. Providing a forum on campus for learning about social 
entrepreneurship and <br />social-profit organizations in China<br /><br />
III. Raising an Impact Fund which CSIP students will donate 
to one of our partner organizations.

</span></p>


<h3 class='fade-in'><span style="color:black">CSIP Program 2017 - 2018</span></h3>
<p class='fade-in'><span style="color:black">
The CSIP Program gives students the opportunity to 
engage with the fast developing social <br />sector in China
 and Hong Kong.Our program this year runs from 
 <b>July 2017 to May 2018. </b><br /><br />
From July to August, students enroll in an online 
course on social impact and organization<br /> evaluation,
 which was developed and provided to us by 
 Philanthropy in Motion, our strategic <br />partner in 
 China. We place students in teams of three and 
 match them with one of our five <br />partner social 
 enterprises for the year. The teams work closely 
 with these enterprises to <br />gain a deep understanding 
 of their business, and ultimately present their 
 learnings in an evaluation<br /> report at the end of 
 the online course. Several of our partner 
 organizations are emerging <br />enterprises that 
 lack capacity in areas where students can provide 
 valuable support. During the fall <br />and spring 
 partner organizations, contributing their skills
 while gaining deep insight into<br /> how these 
 organizations are creating change. Example 
 projects include conducting<br /> market research,
 case studies,and basic financial modeling.
