				<h3 class='fade-in'>What we do</h3>
<p class='fade-in'>
CSIP is a Princeton student organization founded in 2017!<br />
Our mission is to empower students to support social <br />
enterprises striving to create a better China by: <br /><br />
I. Empowering students with the knowledge and tools they<br />
need to evaluate and provide project-based support to our <br />partner organizations.<br /><br />

II. Providing a forum on campus for learning about social <br />
entrepreneurship and social-profit organizations in China<br /><br />
III. Raising an Impact Fund which CSIP students will donate <br />
to one of our partner organizations.

</p>


<h3 class='fade-in'>CSIP Program 2017 - 2018</h3>
<p class='fade-in'>
The CSIP Program gives students the opportunity to <br />
engage with the fast developing social sector in China<br />
 and Hong Kong.Our program this year runs from <br />
 <b>July 2017 to May 2018. </b><br /><br />
From July to August, students enroll in an online <br />
course on social impact and organization evaluation,<br />
 which was developed and provided to us by <br />
 Philanthropy in Motion, our strategic partner in <br />
 China. We place students in teams of three and <br />
 match them with one of our five partner social <br />
 enterprises for the year. The teams work closely <br />
 with these enterprises to gain a deep understanding <br />
 of their business, and ultimately present their <br />
 learnings in an evaluation report at the end of <br />
 the online course. Several of our partner <br />
 organizations are emerging enterprises that <br />
 lack capacity in areas where students can provide <br />
 valuable support. During the fall and spring <br />
 semesters, students work on projects for the<br />
 partner organizations, contributing their skills<br />
 while gaining deep insight into how these <br />
 organizations are creating change. Example <br />
 projects include conducting market research,<br />
 case studies,and basic financial modeling.

										<blockquote>
										<cite>
										We believe that people can achieve <br />
better outcomes when they make <br />
collective decisions on how to <br />
donate to causes they care about<br />
During the fall semester, CSIP<br />
 raised an Impact Fund of up <br />
 to $7,000 to provide financial <br />
 support to one of our partner <br />
 organizations. In 2018, The CSIP <br />
 cohort will collectively deliberate<br />
 and decide on how to donate the fund <br />
 to an organization they believe can<br />
 make the most impact with our <br />
 support. This aspect of what we<br />
 do is inspired by the growing <br />
 movement of venture philanthropy<br />
 around the world.<br />
